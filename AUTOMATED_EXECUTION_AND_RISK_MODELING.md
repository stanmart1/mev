# Automated Liquidation Execution & Advanced Risk Modeling

## Overview

This document covers the implementation of two advanced features for the MEV Analytics Platform:

1. **Automated Liquidation Execution** - Fully automated liquidation bot with queue management
2. **Advanced Risk Modeling** - ML-enhanced risk assessment with multiple risk factors

## 🤖 Automated Liquidation Execution

### LiquidationExecutor Service

**File**: `src/services/liquidationExecutor.js`

The LiquidationExecutor provides fully automated liquidation capabilities with the following features:

#### Key Features

1. **Queue Management**
   - Concurrent execution (up to 3 liquidations simultaneously)
   - Priority-based queue with age-based expiration
   - Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff

2. **Transaction Management**
   - Priority fee adjustment for faster execution
   - Compute budget optimization
   - Confirmation timeout and retry handling

3. **Protocol Support**
   - Solend liquidation instructions
   - Port Finance liquidation instructions  
   - Francium liquidation instructions
   - Extensible for additional protocols

4. **Safety Features**
   - Pre-execution validation
   - Maximum gas price limits
   - Slippage protection
   - Minimum profit thresholds

#### Configuration Options

```javascript
{
  maxGasPrice: 0.02,           // Maximum 0.02 SOL for gas
  maxSlippage: 0.03,           // 3% maximum slippage
  confirmationTimeout: 30000,   // 30 seconds
  retryAttempts: 3,            // Retry failed executions
  minProfitThreshold: 0.005,   // Minimum 0.005 SOL profit
  priorityFeeMultiplier: 1.5   // 50% higher priority fee
}
```

#### Execution Statistics

The executor tracks comprehensive metrics:

- **totalExecutions**: Total liquidations attempted
- **successfulExecutions**: Successfully completed liquidations
- **failedExecutions**: Failed liquidation attempts
- **totalProfitRealized**: Cumulative profit in SOL
- **averageExecutionTime**: Average time per execution
- **gasSpent**: Total gas costs in SOL
- **successRate**: Success percentage

#### API Integration

Fully integrated with the liquidation scanner via event listeners:

```javascript
// Auto-queue profitable opportunities
liquidationScanner.on('liquidationOpportunity', async (opportunity) => {
  if (shouldAutoExecute(opportunity)) {
    await liquidationExecutor.queueLiquidation(opportunity);
  }
});
```

## 🧠 Advanced Risk Modeling

### AdvancedRiskModel Service

**File**: `src/services/advancedRiskModel.js`

The AdvancedRiskModel provides sophisticated risk assessment using multiple weighted factors and machine learning adjustments.

#### Risk Factors Framework

**1. Market Risk Factors (60% total weight)**

- **Volatility (25% weight)**
  - Analyzes price volatility of collateral tokens
  - Thresholds: Low (<5%), Medium (5-15%), High (15-30%)
  - Higher volatility = higher liquidation risk

- **Liquidity (20% weight)**  
  - Assesses available liquidity for token swaps
  - Thresholds: High (>$100k), Medium ($10k-$100k), Low (<$1k)
  - Lower liquidity = higher execution risk

- **Market Trend (15% weight)**
  - 24-hour price trend analysis
  - Bullish (>5% up), Neutral (±2%), Bearish (<-5% down)
  - Bearish trends increase liquidation probability

**2. Position-Specific Factors (30% total weight)**

- **Health Factor (20% weight)**
  - Core liquidation metric
  - Critical (<0.95), Danger (0.95-1.0), Warning (1.0-1.05)
  - Lower health factor = higher urgency, lower timing risk

- **Position Size (10% weight)**
  - Collateral value in USD
  - Small (<$100), Medium ($100-$1k), Large (>$10k)
  - Larger positions attract more competition

**3. Execution Risk Factors (10% total weight)**

- **Competition (10% weight)**
  - Estimated number of competing bots
  - Time-of-day adjustments (US hours = higher competition)
  - Protocol-specific competition levels

#### Machine Learning Adjustments

The model applies ML-based adjustments:

1. **Historical Performance**
   - Analyzes past liquidation success rates for similar opportunities
   - Adjusts risk score based on historical outcomes
   - ±1 point adjustment based on success patterns

2. **Seasonal Factors**
   - Time-of-day competition adjustments
   - Weekend competition reduction (-0.5 points)
   - Late night execution advantages (-0.3 points)

3. **Model Performance Tracking**
   - Accuracy percentage based on predictions vs outcomes
   - False positive/negative tracking
   - Continuous model improvement

#### Risk Score Calculation

```javascript
// Weighted average of all factors
riskScore = Σ(factor.score × factor.weight) / Σ(factor.weight)

// Apply ML adjustments
finalScore = baseScore + historicalAdjustment + seasonalAdjustment

// Ensure bounds [1, 10]
finalScore = Math.max(1, Math.min(10, finalScore))
```

#### Risk Level Interpretation

- **1-3 (LOW)**: Immediate execution recommended
- **4-6 (MEDIUM)**: Execute with caution
- **7-10 (HIGH)**: Manual review recommended

## 🔄 Integration & Workflow

### Complete Liquidation Workflow

1. **Discovery**: Scanner detects liquidatable position
2. **Basic Risk**: Calculate simple health factor risk
3. **Advanced Risk**: Calculate weighted risk score using multiple factors
4. **Auto-Execution Decision**: Evaluate against safety thresholds
5. **Queue Management**: Add to execution queue if approved
6. **Transaction Creation**: Build protocol-specific liquidation transaction
7. **Execution**: Send transaction with priority fees
8. **Confirmation**: Wait for blockchain confirmation
9. **Result Analysis**: Calculate actual profit and update statistics
10. **Model Update**: Feed results back to risk model for learning

### Safety Mechanisms

**Auto-Execution Safeguards:**
- Risk score threshold (default: ≤6)
- Minimum profit requirement (default: 0.01 SOL)
- Maximum position size (default: $1000)
- Health factor validation (must be <1.0)

**Execution Safeguards:**
- Maximum gas price limits
- Transaction timeout protection
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Position validation before execution

**Risk Model Safeguards:**
- Multiple independent risk factors
- Historical performance validation
- Conservative default values
- Continuous accuracy monitoring
