# Solana MEV Analytics App - Implementation Guide

## Project Overview
Build a comprehensive MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) analytics platform for Solana that serves validators, searchers, developers, and researchers with real-time opportunity detection, bundle construction, and educational tools.

## Phase 1: Backend Foundation & Data Layer

### 1.1 Project Setup
**Prompt:** "Create a Node.js project structure for a Solana MEV analytics platform. Include package.json with dependencies for Solana web3.js, WebSocket connections, PostgreSQL, Express.js, and real-time data processing. Set up environment configuration for Solana devnet RPC endpoints and database connections."

### 1.2 Database Schema Design
**Prompt:** "Design a PostgreSQL database schema for storing MEV opportunities, validator metrics, and performance data. Include tables for: MEV opportunities (timestamp, DEX, token pairs, profit potential), validator performance (epoch, MEV rewards, regular rewards), searcher analytics (success rates, profits), and historical bundle data."

### 1.3 Solana Connection Service
**Prompt:** "Create a Solana connection service that establishes WebSocket connections to devnet. Include functions to monitor DEX transactions on Raydium, Orca, and Serum. Set up transaction parsing to extract relevant MEV data from program logs."

## Phase 2: MEV Detection Engine

### 2.1 Real-Time Transaction Monitor
**Prompt:** "Build a real-time transaction monitoring service that subscribes to Solana program logs for major DEXs. Parse transaction data to identify token swaps, prices, and volumes. Store this data efficiently for opportunity analysis."

### 2.2 Arbitrage Detection Algorithm
**Prompt:** "Implement an arbitrage detection algorithm that compares token prices across different DEXs (Raydium, Orca, Serum). Calculate potential profit opportunities accounting for trading fees, slippage, and minimum profit thresholds. Store detected opportunities in the database."

### 2.3 Liquidation Opportunity Scanner
**Prompt:** "Create a liquidation opportunity scanner for Solend and other lending protocols. Monitor loan positions, collateral ratios, and liquidation thresholds. Identify positions approaching liquidation and calculate potential liquidation profits."

### 2.4 Sandwich Attack Detection

JWT.
Solana wallet login (Phantom, Solflare).
Authorization:
Role-based access control (validators, searchers, researchers, admins).
API Key Management:
Users can generate and revoke API keys.
Usage limits tied to subscription plans.

User Profiles:
Store preferences (alert thresholds, favorite validators, saved simulations).
Subscription Tiers:
Free, Pro, Enterprise with feature-based restrictions (e.g., real-time data and bot generator for Pro+ only).
Security:
Use JWT tokens for APIs, refresh tokens for sessions.
Implement secure password recovery flows.
Rate-limit login attempts

## Phase 6: Frontend Dashboard Foundation
