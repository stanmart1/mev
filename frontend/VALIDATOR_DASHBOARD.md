## API Integration Points

The components expect the following API endpoints:

```typescript
// Historical performance data
GET /api/validators/${validatorPubkey}/historical?range=${timeRange}

// Epoch performance comparison
GET /api/validators/${validatorPubkey}/epoch-performance?limit=20

// Jito status and metrics
GET /api/validators/${validatorPubkey}/jito-status

// MEV earnings data
GET /api/validators/${validatorPubkey}/mev-earnings
```

## WebSocket Channels

```typescript
// Real-time subscriptions
'historical_performance' - Historical earnings updates
'epoch_performance' - Epoch comparison data
'jito_status' - Jito metrics and status
'mev_earnings' - Live earnings updates
```

## Navigation Integration
